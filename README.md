# Power-BI-Diversity-and-Inclusion
#### This project analyzes workforce diversity and inclusion across various departments (finance, HR, operations, etc.) categorized by job levels (executive to junior officer), age groups (16-69), and regions (elsewhere, Europe, Switzerland). Key insights include gender representation in hiring, promotions, and turnover rates for FY20 and FY21. The dashboard provides detailed breakdowns by department, age group, job level, and region, while also exploring executive gender balance, performance ratings, and diversity metrics such as nationality and regional distribution. The project offers actionable insights into workforce composition and progression.
